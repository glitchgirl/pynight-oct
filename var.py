#Assign the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to the variables one, two, and three.
#Then add them together as the value of another variable named six (six = one + two + three).
#  Once you have done this you will reassign the variable one to represent the number 100, then ask python what value your variable, six, represents.
#Having just re-assigned the value of the variable one, did the value of the variable six then change? Submit yes or no as your answer.
